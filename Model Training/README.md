## Training

To perform the training, the dataset needs to be prepared. In this case, we should include annotations of the images. Labellmg is an application which performs this task.

After the process, we'll get a .txt file for each image of the same name denoting the position of the snake in each image. The .txt file along with the image must be put in the same folder. This folder must compressed into a zip folder and uploaded tp the Google Drive. This compressed file will be used during the training process.
